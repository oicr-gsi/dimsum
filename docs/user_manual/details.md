# Detail Pages

Projects, donors, requisitions, cases, and runs each have their own Details page. The Details page
includes more information about the selected item, all of its cases and QC gates, and the metrics
for each associated item. Clicking on the name of a project, donor, requisition, or run takes you to
the corresponding details page. Clicking on an assay name in the cases table links to the Case
Details page.

### Metrics

Columns containing QC metrics provide tool tips detailing the exact required threshold. Hover over
the recorded number to see its requirements. The cell will be shaded red if the requirement is not
met, and yellow if the value is unavailable.

### Bulk QC Operations in MISO

To perform bulk QC operations in MISO, select the desired table entries by clicking the checkbox at
the left of each item you wish to include. Next, scroll to the bottom of the table and click the
"QC in MISO". This will open the MISO
[Run-Library Metrics](https://miso-lims.readthedocs.io/projects/docs/en/latest/user_manual/qc_integration/)
page in a new tab. You can then perform your desired QC operations for all of the selected items.

**NOTE:** Only items with the same assay and library design may be selected in bulk to view in MISO.
Entries selected that do not meet this requirement (ie. have different assays and/or library
designs) will induce an ERROR popup after pressing the "QC in MISO" button.
