# Complete Case Sign-Offs

The final three QC steps are completed at the case level. These sign-offs are recorded in another
system (Nabu), but can be completed from Dimsum.

| QC Step | Description | Requirements |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Analysis Review | Confirmation that the analysis data is good | Approval for each deliverable type - clinical report and/or data release |
| Release Approval | Approval to release deliverables to the collaborator | Approval for each deliverable type - clinical report and/or data release |
| Release | Confirmation that a specific deliverable was delivered | Approval for each specific deliverable |

When a case is stopped, release approval and release QC steps are still required in order to
indicate that any partial results or failed deliverable have been delivered as required.

1. Find and select the cases you wish to sign off.
    1. Cases can be found on the main QC Dashboard, or on the Cases table on the Project, Donor,
       Case, or Requisition Details pages.
    2. Use the sorting and filter functions if necessary to help find the cases.
    3. Select the cases using the checkboxes at the left side of the table.
    4. You can use the checkbox in the header to select all cases currently shown in the table. If
       there are multiple pages of cases in the table, this only selects the current page.
    5. Note that all the options you choose will apply to every case that you select. If you wish to
       set a different status or note for some cases, you will need to select and sign them off them
       separately.
2. Click the <img src="../../../../images/signoff_button.png" alt="Sign Off button" width="64"> button at the top or bottom of the table
3. In the dialog that appears, choose the QC step and deliverable type you wish to sign off and
   click "Submit."

   QC step, you will also need to specify which deliverable you wish to sign off. Click "Submit"
   when you are done.

5. Another dialog should confirm that your sign-offs were saved successfully. Once you close the
   dialog, the page will refresh to show the updated cases.
