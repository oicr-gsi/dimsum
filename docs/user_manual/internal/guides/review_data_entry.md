# Review Data Entry

You may wish to periodically review metrics and sign-offs for a project to help catch errors that
would otherwise delay the final case review and data/report releases.

1. On the main [QC Dashboard](../qc_dashboard.md), filter for the desired project by
   clicking the "+ filter" dropdown and selecting "Project" from the drop down menu. Enter the
   project name in the text box and press enter or click the checkmark to confirm. The table will
   refresh automatically.

2. Under the "Project" column, click the project name. This will take you to the
   [Project Details](../details.md) page.

3. In the navigation bar at the top of the page, select the tab for the QC gate you wish to review -
   "Extractions," for example. This will display a table listing all items for the selected gate
   within the project.

4. Review the table to ensure that data has been entered correctly, and sign-offs have been
   completed.
