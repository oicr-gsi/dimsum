# QC Dashboard
This is the main dashboard users are presented with upon logging in. Users can view all projects and associated samples and statuses presented in a table format. Navigate back to this page by clicking on the Dimsum logo on the top left of all pages.

Below are some notable columns briefly outlined.

### Project
Lists the associated project(s) and their appropriate pipeline. Clicking on the project(s)|name will redirect the user to the Project Details page, where you can view X Y Z for the project in question.

### Donor
Lists the donor associated, the external name assigned, and the tissue origin and type.

Clicking on the donor associated will redirect the user to the Donor Details page, where you can view the information associated with the donor in question. Clicking on the MISO icon next to the donor name will redirect you to its corresponding MISO page

### Assay
Lists the assay relevant to the table entry.

### Receipt/Inspection

### Test

### QC Gates
The QC Gates columns are the following:

- Extraction
- Library Preparation
- Library Qualification
- Full-Depth Sequencing
- Informatics Review
- Draft Report
- Final Report

Each column will consist of X's and checkmarks representing whether a case has passed the corresponding column. In the QC gate appoval process, so long as each column contains a checkmark, it has passed said gate. Hover over the X's and checkmarks to view a tooltip describing the sample name, project, donor, and requisition.

A QC gate cell may also be coloured and/or contain an icon indicating pending/in-progress work. Hover over any icon appearing in the table for more information on the run, library aliquot, project, donor, and more.

See the table below for a full description of the different icons which may appear:

| Icon | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
