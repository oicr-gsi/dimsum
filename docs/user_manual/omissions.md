# Omissions Page

The Omissions page lists all received samples that will not be included in cases or displayed in
other areas of Dimsum. Samples appearing here either

1. are not included in a requisition
2. do not have an assay assigned to the requisition
3. have an assay which has not been fully defined with tests

Note that samples are not included here if their project is inactive or has pipeline "Sample
Tracking only"
