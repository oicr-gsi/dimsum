# Review Sign Offs for a Case
When getting ready to release a clinal report, a user from CGI must ensure that all sign offs have been completed prior to sending for final approval.

1. On the main QC Dashboard, filter for the desired requisition by pressing the filter icon and selecting "Requisition" from the drop down menu.<br><br>Once the desired requisition has been entered, the table should refresh automatically.<br><br>

2. Under the "Assay" column, press the assay or requisition name outlined in green. This will redirect you to the requisition's details page.<br><br>

3. Review the requisition's details page table. Ensure that no column  has been highlighted yellow or red, indicating "waiting" or "failed" gates. Non-coloured (white) columns indicate that the gate has been passed.

**NOTE:** A column may contain both 'X''s and checkmarks, indicating failed and passed gates. So long as the column contains at least one checkmark (potentially before or after an 'X'), the QC gate has been passed.
