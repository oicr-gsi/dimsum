This is the documentation for external users. **Internal Users**: [See internal documentation here](../../).

Dimsum is your dashboard for observing the state and progress of your projects. Work is grouped into
cases and you can use Dimsum to track the progress of each case, from sample receipt to release of
any deliverables.
