## Case Summary Report

This report lists each case and summarizes its progress, showing the dates that each step was
completed, and the status of each deliverable. All cases in the table are included, including those
on other pages. Any filters applied to the table will affect which cases are included. The report
is generated from any table of cases, including the main QC dashboard, and the Cases table on
various detail pages. To generate the report, apply any filters you'd like, then click the "Download
All" button and select "Case Summary Report" in the dialog.
