Dimsum can be used for a number of tasks and processes at OICR, including the following:

### 1. QC Approvals

Dimsum facilitates the QC approval processes at OICR. Users can see the QC status of all items
involved in a case, including which are still pending sign-off. Metrics for each item can be viewed
within Dimsum so that QC decisions can be made quickly. Notifications are sent for runs and
run-libraries requiring sign-off.

### 2. Project Tracking (not yet completed)

Dimsum holds [Project Detail](/user_manual/details/) pages which aid in determining the overall
status of a project.

### 3. Task Tracking (not yet completed)

Based on the assays assigned to received samples, Dimsum shows all pending work and helps to
prioritize and assign tasks not necessarily related to QC approvals.

### 4. Turn-Around Time Tracking (not yet completed)

Dimsum tracks and displays the overall time a case has been in progress, including the time spent in
each QC gate. Notifications may warn if a case is falling behind schedule.

### 5. Invoicing (not yet completed)

Dimsum's consolidation of information simplifies the process of pulling information for the purpose
of sending out bills.
