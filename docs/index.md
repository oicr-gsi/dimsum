Dimsum can be used for a number of tasks and processes at OICR, including the following:

### 1. QC Approvals
Dimsum the current QC approval processes at OICR, and eases the addition of future processes. Cases and their corresponding projects can be reviewed and approved for QC. Users can additionally view which cases still require QC, for which gates, as well as the thresholds for each QC approval.

### 2. Project Tracking
Dimsum holds top-down status pages which aid in determining the overall status of a project at a level more granular than QC gates.

### 3. Task Tracking
Technicians can be notified of tasks, as well as view the aforementioned status pages to better prioritize tasks not necessarily related to QC approvals.

### 4. TAT Tracking
Users can be notified of and view how long a case/sample has been in their current QC gate, how long overall it has been since sample receipt, etc. 

### 5. Invoicing
Dimsum's consolidation of information simplifies the process of pulling information for the purpose of sending out bills.
