This is the documentation for internal users. **External Users**: [See external documentation here](user_manual/external/).

Dimsum can be used for a number of tasks and processes at OICR, including the following:

### 1. QC Approvals

Dimsum facilitates the QC approval processes at OICR. Users can see the QC status of all items
involved in a case, including which are still pending sign-off. Metrics for each item can be viewed
within Dimsum so that QC decisions can be made quickly. Notifications are sent for runs and
run-libraries requiring sign-off.

### 2. Project Tracking

The [Projects](user_manual/projects.md) list page shows a high level summary of each project's
progress, and allows generating project-level reports.

The [Project Detail](user_manual/details.md) pages aid in further determining the status of a
project, checking its progress, and examining its cases.

### 3. Turn-Around Time (TAT) Tracking

Dimsum tracks and displays the overall time a case has been in progress, including the time spent in
each QC step, and sometimes even a more detailed breakdown of multiple parts of that step.

The [QC Dashboard](user_manual/qc_dashboard.md) displays TAT information and warnings if a case or
any QC step is behind schedule. The table is sorted by urgency to bring attention to cases that are
falling behind.

The [Case TAT Report](user_manual/reports.md#case-tat-report) provides a detailed breakdown of the
TAT for all of the tests in each selected case.

The [TAT Trend Report](user_manual/reports.md#tat-trend-report) allows you to plot TAT information
with different groupings to help identify and understand trends.

### 4. Task Tracking (not yet completed)

Based on the assays assigned to received samples, Dimsum shows all pending work and helps to
prioritize and assign tasks not necessarily related to QC approvals.

### 5. Invoicing (not yet completed)

Dimsum's consolidation of information simplifies the process of pulling information for the purpose
of sending out bills.
